      <p class="text-primary text-justify" >Kratie Province, located on the east bank of the Mekong River, attracts a fair share of visitors, many of whom wish to catch a glimpse of the last few Irrawaddy
        Dolphins left in the world. The recommended place to see them is Kampi Village, about 15 kilometers from town.
        Irrawaddy Dolphins are an endangered species and are extremely rare; it is estimated there are only about 60 living in this stretch of the river.
        The town of Kratie offers an authentic rural ambience, and therefore serves as the perfect place to spend a peaceful night or two. It is a nice relief from some of the countryâ€™s more trafficked areas.</p>
